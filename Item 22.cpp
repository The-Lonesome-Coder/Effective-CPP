/**
 * Declare data members private.

/**
 * Why not public data members?
 *
 * 1.  If everything in the public interface is a function, clients wonâ€™t have to scratch their heads trying to
 *     remember whether to use parentheses when they want to access a member of the class.
 *
 * 2. Encapsulation.
 *    2-1. If you implement access to a data member through a function, you can later replace the data
 *          member with a computation, and nobody using your class will be any the wiser.
 *    2-2. If you hide your data members from your clients,  you can ensure that class invariants are always
 *         maintained, because only member functions can affect them.
 *    2-3. You reserve the right to change your implementation decisions later.
