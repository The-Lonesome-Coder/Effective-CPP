 * Pay attention to compiler warnings.
 *
 * Take compiler warnings seriously, and strive to compile warning free at the maximum warning level
 * supported by your compilers.
 *
 * Don’t become dependent on compiler warnings, because different compilers warn about different things.
 * Porting to a new compiler may eliminate warning messages you’ve come to rely on.
